# Fiber Test

## Description
This repository is a simple test environment for experimenting with the Fiber web framework for Go. Fiber is a lightweight and fast web framework built on top of Fasthttp, making it ideal for building high-performance web servers in Go. Inspired by Express.js, Fiber provides a similar API and middleware pattern for building web applications in Go.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this repository is not a full-fledged project but rather a testing ground for exploring Fiber's features and performance. It should not be considered as production-ready code but rather as a learning and experimentation tool.
